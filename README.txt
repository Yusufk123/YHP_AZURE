# Make sure you also have the Summer 2022 project folder Before you begin following this Folder
# However, use the academic success in the fall 2022 project folder instead of summer 2022 if you want to have everything ready to use with AWS beanstalk for deployment
# Fall 2022 code has Aws properties file whereas the summer 2022 code only has properties file for the local instance
# VERY IMPORTANT!! Open the academic-success folder to code in your IDE, such as IntelliJ Idea or your preferred IDE. Not the project folder.
